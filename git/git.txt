GitHub:
* Multiple developers involved in application development.
* Application developers will be working from different locations

In this situation we dace two problems:
---------------------------------------
1.How to integrate source code?
2. How to monitor changes happening to source code?

Repository:
----------
where our code will be stored and documents related project.

* Every developer will install a client software in their system.
* Client software is used to interact with version control software.

Developer-->client software--> version control software

It provides solution for 2 problems:
version control software server : will be on different system.

url,username and password--> for repository.
image: 1.git

* there are several VCS softwares available:
        1.CVS
		2.clear case
		3.SVN (Sub Version)
		*4.Git Hub
		*5.Git Bucket.
GitHub:
------
* It is a provider of internet hosting for software developement and version control using Git.
   It offers the distributed version control and source management functionality of Git + its own features.
   * cloud Platform
   * Microsoft owned
 * Github is a cloud provider which is providing software version control managemnt using git.
 * Git hub is implemented in Ruby and it is under license of microsoft.
 * Using GitHub we can maintain repositories in cloud platform.
 * In order to create repositories we need to have account in github.
 
 Github-- build, ship and maintain their software on github.
 
 Sign up to Github.
 Repositories--2:
 ------------
 *public and private.
 
Task:
* create a github account and create repository.
repo url :https://github.com/AkhilGorantlaAG/GitHubLearn.git

Github connection:
Git client, GitLab etc.,

Git:
* Download git client software.
  git-scm.com/downloads and install it.
* To communicate with github repositories. we will use gut client software.
* git client is available in multiple ways:
   *git bash
   *git GUI
   *source tree etc.,
Task:
* create a empty folder git practise in your system.
* establish communication between folder and repository.
   open folder 
   git bash--> git init
                      wiill create a hidden file .git
			   * Create a simple hello world java program.
			   * git status
			            will get status of all files.
						status -untracked: means file newly created.
				* git add FileName
				         will add the new file. it will be added to staging area.
				* git status
				* git commit -m 'message'
				          will be commited to github.
				* git branch -M main
				          should commit to main branch in git
				* git remote add origin url_of_repo
				           need to run  only once it add url.
				         check config file before and after add origin we can find that remote url will be added.
				* git push -u origin branchname
                  git push -u origin main
				
Git commands:
------------
* git init
* git add <fileName>
* git commit -m 'message'
* git branch -M main	
* git remote add origin <repo-URl>
* git push -u origin main
